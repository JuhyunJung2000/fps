    <h1>Web development progress</h1>
    <p>I began to look into web development just recently, I saw that among the preferred qualifications a project of some sort would really help.</p>
    <p>I wasn't sure how I could convey to whom that is in concern, what I had learned over the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>Then I thought a website would do the job, but I never had made one before.</p>
    <p>I went to udemy to find  a popular course on web development.</p>
    <p>The course is by Angela Yu and its called <i>The Complete Web Development Bootcamp</i>.</p>
    <p>I was able to learn basic HTML and CSS to make this simple site within a day.</p>
    <p>And hopefully I will get on to some Javascript next in coming days.</p>

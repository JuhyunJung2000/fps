    <p>The guitar was my first instrument ever.</p>
    <p>My father had advised me to learn it as it would be of much benefit in the future.</p>
    <p>At the time I was not intersted at all and I did not want to learn it.</p>
    <p>One day someone showed me a video of a young guitarist named Sungha Jung.</p>
    <p>And instantly it made a strong impression on my younger self.</p>
    <p>I began to practice and teach myself through various videos and this is how I began to play.</p>
    <p>Due to the busy college student life style I haven't had much time to learn but I like to pick it up from time to time.</p>

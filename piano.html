    <h1>Piano</h1>
    <p>About three summers ago my mother gifted me with a digitial piano.</p>
    <p>Sure I loved the sound of the piano but I never saw myself playing it.</p>
    <p>I tried to learn some chords and songs in appreciation of the gift.</p>
    <p>Later I came to face some hard times, it was then I spent hours at the piano to forget about the present and lose myself for a moment.</p>
    <p>I never knew I had improved so much as I only played for myself.</p>
    <p>Later I came to play for my church and even teach others.</p>

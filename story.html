<body style="background-color: #ffe4e1;">
  <p width="70%">Born in South Korea on the 16th of Novemeber 2000, I grew up in a small suburb located in
    the city of Daejeon.</p>

  <p>A time came when my father decided that he wanted a change for our family and he moved to
    Ireland to study english.</p>
  <p>A year passsed and due to many reasons my mother, my brother and I also flew across the world to join my father.</p>
  <p>I was about 8 years old at the time.</p>
  <p>We soon became adapt to Ireland and the lifestyle here.</p>
  <p>I deeply enjoyed mathematics and problem solving from an early age and hence I chose to pursue engineering.
  </p>
  <p>However for some reason it never sat right with me.</p>
  <p>I thought that I had chosen the wrong career and for the last few months I
    contemplated on what I really wanted to do.</p>
  <p>I decided to try coding seeing the popularity of it. </p>
  <p>I found out that I really enjoyed coding and saw myself studying this further.</p>
  <p>This is how I came about making this basic site. Thanks for reading.</p>
